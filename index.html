                <p>Well the memory from this Middile School was not so good
                    for
                    me
                    beause i was bad boy
                    on that time because i never listen anyones suggesions yeah i was really a bad habbits to move
                    arrounds
                    with
                    some bad guys and
                    also because of i was a kid on that time thats the reason i never listen anyones order and yeah for
                    your
                    kind
                    information i never
                    went to that Middile Schools and also because of that school was goverment school so i never wanted
                    to
                    go
                    and
                    thats the reason in just
                    one year i leave that school.

            <li><strong>Balgyan Shidha Ashram ~ </strong>
                <p> when i leave the Rajkeya Madhya Vidhyalaya so my family decided
                    i will be okay in the boarding School so i got addmission in the Hostel(Boarding High School) and
                    you
                    know
                    what
                    in just
                    one week i run from that school and teachers cannot catch me and because i was good at running so
                    because i
                    remembered the path
                    well because the Hostel was near from our house and you can say the hostel is sitiuated at Adampur
                    Bhagalpur
                    thats why i came back
                    home and yeah i hurt my family for doing that and that is the reason papa beaten me and then after
                    they
                    decided
                    they i am not going to
                    good boy so they just leave me for 2 to 3 month without telling anything and then after they decided
                    to
                    my
                    addmission will be in CMS School.
